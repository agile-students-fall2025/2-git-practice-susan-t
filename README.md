- https://radixweb.com/blog/edtech-revolution-software-development-is-reshaping-education-industry

I've always had a huge fascination with the intersection of CS and Education. This article specifically hits on Edtech and discusses it's revolutionization due to Software Development. Most specifically how different platforms and the accessibility of remote learning have impacted and shifted the way education is taught. 

I find the concept of Edtech as always positive and optimistic. This article touches on the fact that the usage of Edtech allows a more _personalized_ and _adaptable_ form of education for students of all ages. No longer are all students forced to endure a "standardized" education, but are able to engage in multiple opportunities that are more exciting and pace-inclusive. I find that this is especially beneficial in allowing students to access a variety of subjects in a way that is conducive to them, for example through a game. Not only that, but Software Development also helps teachers and administrators to streamline activities and assessment procedures. It also allows for a more in depth look into student performance. 

Overall, this article proves the important role tech plays in education. With education being so important by itself, it's essential for education to take advantage of the resources and capabilities that technology provides. To tie this in with my personal beleifs, I also find that this article emphasizes the necessity of computer science education within the classes as the world increasinly is more technologically advanced day by day. __It's important to teach tech in a meaningful way to assist with students' comprehension but also usage of tech.__
